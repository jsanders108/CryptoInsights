This React website project combines my frontend developer skills with my deep knowledge of market research. At the end of December 2022, I created, programmed, and distributed an 18 question online survey about cryptocurrencies to members of a QuestionPro Audience panel. I wanted to explore the following areas among the general U.S. public:

-Awareness of and familiarity with cryptocurrencies

-Whether or not cryptocurrencies are currently owned (and which ones)

-Why (or why not) cryptocurrencies are currently owned

-Attitudes towards cryptocurrencies

-Likelihood to purchase cryptocurrencies in the future

After gathering 178 completed surveys, I processed and analyzed the results using SPSS. Next, I created a report consisting of 37 PowerPoint slides, which I uploaded to this website. On the "Detailed Results" page, I created dynamic buttons for the four separate areas of the survey to make it easier to view/hide the results (e.g., click on the "Ownership" button to view/hide the results pertaining to that particular theme). 

Building on the cryptocurrency theme, I added a page to the website that tracks the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap via a Coingecko API call. Top trending coins are also included (via a separate API call).
